    A tool for grading cleaned and structured content to evaluate if it sufficiently answers the user query.

    **Purpose:**
    - Designed to assess whether the cleaned and structured content is relevant and comprehensive enough 
      to address the user's original query.
    - It ensures that the content can serve as a reliable basis for answering the query.

    **Usage Guidelines:**
    - Use this tool after the content has been cleaned and structured.
    - Populate the `cleaned_content` field with the refined text that needs to be evaluated.
    - Provide the `user_query` to establish the context and criteria for grading the content.
    - The output should indicate whether the content can sufficiently answer the query or if further refinement or retrieval is needed.
