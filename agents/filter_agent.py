    A tool for cleaning and refining plain, raw, and unstructured retrieved data.

    **Purpose:**
    - This tool is specifically designed to transform raw, messy, and unstructured text into clean, concise, 
      and well-structured content that is easy to read and understand.
    - It ensures that only essential and valuable information is retained while removing unnecessary or irrelevant elements.

    **Usage Guidelines:**
    - **Always use this tool whenever you have retrieved data**.
    - Populate the `retrieved_content` field with the raw data that requires cleaning.
    - Provide the original query in the `user_query` field to help contextualize and guide the refinement process.
    - Use this tool to enhance the clarity and usability of the retrieved content, making it more structured and valuable for users.
